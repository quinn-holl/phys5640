Projects for Comp Phys UVA

Above you'll find macros for some of my completed projects for the Computational Physics Course given at UVA. Some of these deal with molecular dynamics simulations, numerically solving the Schrodinger equation in arbitrary potential energies, either in 1D or taking advantage of certain symmetries to solve 3D cases, and other quantum collision processes.
